    I act as the middleman between agencies and writers so that you can both get what you need without any delays, surprises or unexpected expenses. 
   You can put testimonials at the beginning or end of the About page, but I placed them here in this outline because it feels like the natural best place – you’ve told the reader how you can help them and now you’re showing how you’ve helped others. If possible, include testimonials from influencers and impressive publications as well as real people.Another great strategy is to include pictures and videos. Photos add a nice personable touch, while prescriptive videos describing your process and/or snapshots behind the curtain of how a product is made go a long way towards consolidating reader trust.exercise will help you face the interview question “Tell me about yourself” confidently.
